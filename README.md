Scrapping with Selenium: The flow begins with the Selenium script executing web scraping tasks. Selenium interacts with the target website, retrieves data, and performs necessary actions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, or extracting information.

Data Processing: Once the scraping is complete, the scraped data is processed and formatted according to your requirements. This may involve cleaning the data, extracting relevant information, or organizing it into a structured format.

Prompt on Telegram: The processed data is then used to generate a prompt or message that needs to be sent on Telegram. The message can contain the scraped information or any other relevant details you want to share with users.

Telegram Bot Interaction: The Telegram bot, deployed on AWS EC2, receives the prompt or message generated in the previous step. The bot handles incoming requests and messages from users.

AWS EC2 Deployment: The Telegram bot application is hosted and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. EC2 provides a scalable and secure environment for running applications in the cloud. It ensures reliable availability and performance of the bot.

User Interaction: Users on Telegram can interact with the bot by sending messages, commands, or requests. They can trigger specific actions or ask for information using predefined commands or natural language queries.
